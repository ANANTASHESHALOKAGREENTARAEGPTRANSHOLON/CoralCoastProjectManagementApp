Updating or Patching NearBeach
==============================

NearBeach and it's framework Django will need frequent updating/patching. (talk about security)


-------------------------------
Updating Django (Web Framework)
-------------------------------

It is recommended to install NearBeach on a Long Term Support (LTS) version of Django.
Security fixes/patches are applied for a longer period of time, helping keep your server secure.

NearBeach currently supports the following Django versions;

- Django Version 3.1+

More information about upgrading Django can be found `found in the Django Documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/howto/upgrade-version/>`_

------------------
Updating NearBeach
------------------

NearBeach will be using the Semantic Versioning system. Version numbers will be
laid out as follows; major.minor.patch

1. MAJOR version changes means a new NearBeach. The changes are extensive that a new number for NearBeach is required.
2. MINOR version changes means new functionality in NearBeach. This could require
    - Database migrations
    - Static file migrations
3. PATCH versions mean very small changes. Usually this is to fix a bug or include a static file that was missing.

    ssh <<webserver IP or address>>

2. Use cd to navigate to your project directory

  .. code-block:: bash

3. Activate your virtual environment for your web server

    source <<virtualenv_location>>/bin/activate

4. Update NearBeach using PIP

  If you require a certain version of NearBeach, use the following code as an
  example

    - Collect any static files

6. Use the following code to apply any migrations

  .. code-block:: bash

    python3 ./manage.py migrate

7. Use the following code to collect any static files

  .. code-block:: bash

    python3 ./manage.py collectstatic

8. Refresh gunicorn to enforce the new version

  .. code-block:: bash

    sudo service gunicorn refresh


Your new version of NearBeach should be ready.

--------------
Caching Issues
--------------

NearBeach does not use a mixer to notify the browser or the cache that the static files (JavaScript, CSS, and Images)
have been updated. This can cause issues when applying a patch for users. We recommend people clean their cache to stop
any issues.


.. note::

    Please note - if you are using services like CloudFlare - it might cache an old version of the static files. You
    will need to purge the cache on these services.
