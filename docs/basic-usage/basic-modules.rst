About
-----

The basic module section is used over the following objects;

* Requirement and Requirement Items
* Projects
* Tasks

It is broken down into the following sections;

* Groups and Users
* Documents
* Linked objects
* Customers
* Bugs
* Misc 
* Notes


Group and Users
---------------

This module will allow you to add/remove groups and users to the particular object. Please note you will need to have a permission base of `Edit` or higher.


.. note:: Users are limited to the groups also assinged to the objects. A user will not have any access to this object, if any of their groups are not included.


Documents
---------

This module will allow you to upload and view other documents. You will also be able to post links and create folders.


Linked objects
--------------

An object can be linked to other different objects. For example a Project can be linked to multiple tasks. These links are two-ways, and thus should appear in the other object as linked.


Customers
---------

This module defines which customers are linked to these objects.


Bugs
----

This module stores any bugs (stored in external applications like bugzilla).


Misc
----

Currently misc stores any tags associated with this particular object.


Notes
-----

Write up any notes for the objects
