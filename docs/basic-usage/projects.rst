#. Add in a project title - this should be short and descriptive. This piece of information will be viewable from the dashboard and any searches.

#. Add in a detailed description of the project. This can contain as much information as required by your team (up to 100,000 characters).

#. Search for the organisation that is associated with this project. If they are not in the list, you can start typing out their name. The search functionality will start working 2 seconds AFTER you have stopped typing. For best results, you could partially type out the name.

#. Define the project's start and finish date. Both these fields can be set into the future, or backdated if needed.

#. By default NearBeach will include your associated groups. Remove any of these groups if they are not needed. Type in the group name in the search bar to find them.

  .. note:: If you have not added a group that you are in to the project, you might lose access to the project. This is a security FEATURE.
